Docker is a standard for Linux containers.

A “Container” - is an isolated runtime inside of Linux.
A “Container” provides a private machine like space under Linux.
Containers will run under any modern Linux Kernel


Containers can :
1)Have their own process space.
2)Have their own network interface.
3)‘Run’ processes as root (inside the container)
4)Have their own disk space.

Container is not a Virtual Machine!
Each Virtual machine has it own guest operating system , with it's own binaries and libraries and own application .
On the Docker guest operating system do not exist , it is running on the operating system of the host machine .
Difference of how much you may utilize is about 30 - 40% .
