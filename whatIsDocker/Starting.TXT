Docker is a standard for Linux containers.

A “Container” - is an isolated runtime inside of Linux.
A “Container” provides a private machine like space under Linux.
Containers will run under any modern Linux Kernel


Containers can :
1)Have their own process space.
2)Have their own network interface.
3)‘Run’ processes as root (inside the container)
4)Have their own disk space.

Container is not a Virtual Machine!
Each Virtual machine has it own guest operating system , with it's
own binaries and libraries and own application .
On the Docker guest operating system do not exist ,
it is running on the operating system of the host machine .
Difference of how much you may utilize is about 30 - 40% .

Docker Terminology :
• Docker Image - The representation of a Docker Container. Kind of
like a JAR or WAR file in Java.
• Docker Container - The standard runtime of Docker. Effectively a
deployed and running Docker Image. Like a Spring Boot Executable
JAR.
• Docker Engine - The code which manages Docker stuff. Creates
and runs Docker Containers.
